# RecomCode
# Project overview
This project develops a plugin for Jetbrains IDEA/Pycharm for facilitating data science scripting via code fragment recommendations. 

## The major features of this plugin are:
* Adaptation of code fragments to the variables and context of your code
* multimodal input, including:  textual queries, and hints by marking parts of the data 
* code fragment groups for common libraries and frameworks as well as own code fragments in Python (currently, as an exemplary library, only Pandas is supported).
